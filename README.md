ENCRYPTION / DECRYPTION

I am currently taking C at NECC. This was my favorite assignment in class so far. 
It is an encryption and decryption program. The instructions from class indicate
writing two seperate programs for this task but it seemed unnecessary and clunky.
The way I chose to write it involves using a switch statement that offers the user
a choice as to whether they would like to encrypt or decrypt in the menu saving
space and time. I recieved 40/40 points for my grade.


ENFORCING PRIVACY WITH CRYPTOGRAPHY

In this exercise youâ€™ll investigate a simple scheme for encrypting and decrypting data.
A company that wants to send data over the Internet has asked you to write a program that will 
encrypt it so that it may be transmitted more securely. All the data is transmitted as four-digit 
integers. Your application should read a four-digit integer entered by the user and encrypt it as follows: 
Replace each digit with the result of adding 7 to the digit and getting the remainder after dividing the new 
value by 10. Then swap the first digit with the third, and swap the second digit with the fourth. Then print 
the encrypted integer. Write a separate application that inputs an encrypted four-digit integer and decrypts
it (by reversing the encryption scheme) to form the original number.
